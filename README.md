# Hey there! 👋 

I'm **Mohammad Ghufran**, a robotics engineer, with **Master of Engineering in Robotics and Automation** from the **University of Arizona**. I'm fascinated by the intersection of **technology and creativity** — whether it's building robots, designing new projects, or experimenting with new tools, I love anything that lets me bring my ideas to life.

📍 Originally from the **cradle of ancient culture, India**, was in **sun-soaked deserts of Arizona**, now ready to explore new opportunities wherever they may take me!

## About Me
- I'm constantly curious and passionate about **robotics, AI, and the endless possibilities they bring**.
- **Current project**: Experimenting with new types of robots and learning how to make them even more efficient and responsive. I love tinkering and seeing how small changes can lead to big breakthroughs.
- I’m an enthusiastic learner, always diving into new tech, tools, and frameworks to see how they can help bring my crazy ideas to life.
- In my free time, I enjoy **playing video games, reading books, and walking in nature**.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Programming**: Python, C++, MATLAB
- **CAD & Prototyping**: SolidWorks, Fusion 360, 3D Printing (FDM, SLA)
