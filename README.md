# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to Ghufran’s World of Robotics 🛠️🤖

I'm **Mohammad Ghufran**, a robotics engineer and developer, currently pursuing my **Master of Engineering in Robotics and Automation** at the **University of Arizona**. My passion lies in creating collaborative robotic systems, making drones, robotic dogs, and other cool gadgets work together in perfect harmony.

📍 Originally from **India**, now in **Arizona**, but open to moving anywhere the robots take me! 🚀

## 🚀 About Me
- I'm passionate about **robot coordination** and **UAV design** – making flying robots lighter, faster, and smarter.
- **Current project**: Building a deformable UAV and making robotic dogs play well with drones. It's like a sci-fi movie come to life!
- Love working with tech like **Python, C++, MATLAB**, **SolidWorks**, **ROS**, and more.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Programming**: Python, C++, MATLAB, ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **CAD & Prototyping**: SolidWorks, Fusion 360, 3D Printing (FDM, SLA)
- **Machine Learning**: Reinforcement Learning, Pathfinding with A* Algorithm

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- I once helped a drone lose **25% of its weight** – no diet needed, just some clever CAD work.
- Developed an integrated **robotic dog and UAV** system. Teamwork makes the dream work, even for robots!
- Played a part in reducing fertilizer usage by **60%** with an agricultural drone, helping make farming more sustainable.
